# Art BPMS Reporting Birt
Art BPMS Reporting Birt is a module which allows creating reports from a Camunda process using eclipse birt emitter.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Go to the cloned repository folder and run `mvn install`
3. Add the following dependency to your process application project's pom:
    ```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.artezio.bpm.camunda.report</groupId>
        <artifactId>camunda-birt-report</artifactId>
        <version>1.0</version>
    </dependency>
    ``` 
4. Now `camunda-birt-report` is available to use.

## Preparation To Design Report
Birt uses report templates (files with `.rptdesign` extension) to generate reports. The section below describes preparing steps to design report templates:
1. Download [Eclipse Birt Report Designer](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/birt/downloads/drops/R-R1-4.8.0-201806261756/birt-report-designer-all-in-one-4.8.0-20180626-win32.win32.x86_64.zip).
2. Unzip it and run eclipse
3. Open `Window -> Perspective -> Open Perspective -> Report Design` 
4. Now you're able to design report templates, for information about report design see [Creating a Report](https://www.eclipse.org/birt/documentation/tutorial/tutorial-2.php)

# Usage
Art BPMS Reporting Birt uses the implementation of `org.camunda.bpm.engine.delegate.JavaDelegate` interface (`BirtDelegate`) which is also a CDI bean,
so to enable it add to your bpmn diagram `Service Task` with `Delegate Expression` implementation and in `Delegate Expression` field put down 
`${birtDelegate}`.

`BirtDelegate` requires some variables, so make sure you pass them to the delegate:
* `template` - the name of a report template file without extension<br/>
* `params` - the params for birt report emitter, this variable represents a map of paramName and paramValue pairs<br/>
* `outputFormat` - the format of output report, accepts `xlsx`, `xls`, `docx`, `doc` values. Note that the values are case insensitive<br/>
* `generatedReport` - an output report in the format of `org.camunda.bpm.engine.variable.value.FileValue`
 
After that add a report template along with bpmn diagram and other resources to your process engine deployment and run a process. 
If you deploy the process engine deployment through [Process Archive](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.10/reference/deployment-descriptors/tags/process-archive/) 
and use the implicit specifying of the resources, don't forget to add `rptdesign` suffix to `additionalResourceSuffixes` property of the `process.xml` file.
